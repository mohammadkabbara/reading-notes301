#  Database Setup

Let's assume we have an already created database with the name spring_hibernate_many_to_many.



We also need to create the employee and project tables along with the employee_project join table with employee_id and project_id as foreign keys:
```
CREATE TABLE `employee` (
  `employee_id` int(11) NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
  `first_name` varchar(50) DEFAULT NULL,
  `last_name` varchar(50) DEFAULT NULL,
  PRIMARY KEY (`employee_id`)
) ENGINE=InnoDB AUTO_INCREMENT=17 DEFAULT CHARSET=utf8;

CREATE TABLE `project` (
  `project_id` int(11) NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
  `title` varchar(50) DEFAULT NULL,
  PRIMARY KEY (`project_id`)
) ENGINE=InnoDB AUTO_INCREMENT=18 DEFAULT CHARSET=utf8;

CREATE TABLE `employee_project` (
  `employee_id` int(11) NOT NULL,
  `project_id` int(11) NOT NULL,
  PRIMARY KEY (`employee_id`,`project_id`),
  KEY `project_id` (`project_id`),
  CONSTRAINT `employee_project_ibfk_1` 
   FOREIGN KEY (`employee_id`) REFERENCES `employee` (`employee_id`),
  CONSTRAINT `employee_project_ibfk_2` 
   FOREIGN KEY (`project_id`) REFERENCES `project` (`project_id`)
) ENGINE=InnoDB DEFAULT CHARSET=utf8;
```
# The Model Classes
The model classes Employee and Project need to be created with JPA annotations:
```
@Entity
@Table(name = "Employee")
public class Employee { 
    // ...
 
    @ManyToMany(cascade = { CascadeType.ALL })
    @JoinTable(
        name = "Employee_Project", 
        joinColumns = { @JoinColumn(name = "employee_id") }, 
        inverseJoinColumns = { @JoinColumn(name = "project_id") }
    )
    Set<Project> projects = new HashSet<>();
   
    // standard constructor/getters/setters
}
@Entity
@Table(name = "Project")
public class Project {    
    // ...  
 
    @ManyToMany(mappedBy = "projects")
    private Set<Employee> employees = new HashSet<>();
    
    // standard constructors/getters/setters   
}
```
As we can see, both the Employee class and Project classes refer to one another, which means that the association between them is bidirectional.

In order to map a many-to-many association, we use the @ManyToMany, @JoinTable and @JoinColumn annotations. Let's have a closer look at them.



The @ManyToMany annotation is used in both classes to create the many-to-many relationship between the entities.

This association has two sides i.e. the owning side and the inverse side. In our example, the owning side is Employee so the join table is specified on the owning side by using the @JoinTable annotation in Employee class. The @JoinTable is used to define the join/link table. In this case, it is Employee_Project.

The @JoinColumn annotation is used to specify the join/linking column with the main table. Here, the join column is employee_id and project_id is the inverse join column since Project is on the inverse side of the relationship.

In the Project class, the mappedBy attribute is used in the @ManyToMany annotation to indicate that the employees collection is mapped by the projects collection of the owner side.
