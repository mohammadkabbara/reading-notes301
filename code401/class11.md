# Create a Web Controller

In Springâ€™s approach to building web sites, HTTP requests are handled by a controller. You can easily identify the controller by the @Controller annotation. In the following example, GreetingController handles GET requests for /greeting by returning the name of a View (in this case, greeting). A View is responsible for rendering the HTML content. The following listing (from src/main/java/com/example/servingwebcontent/GreetingController.java) shows the controller:

```
package com.example.servingwebcontent;

import org.springframework.stereotype.Controller;
import org.springframework.ui.Model;
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.GetMapping;
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.RequestParam;

@Controller
public class GreetingController {

	@GetMapping("/greeting")
	public String greeting(@RequestParam(name="name", required=false, defaultValue="World") String name, Model model) {
		model.addAttribute("name", name);
		return "greeting";
	}

}
```

## Spring Boot Devtools

A common feature of developing web applications is coding a change, restarting your application, and refreshing the browser to view the change. This entire process can eat up a lot of time. To speed up this refresh cycle, Spring Boot offers with a handy module known as spring-boot-devtools. Spring Boot Devtools:

Enables hot swapping.

Switches template engines to disable caching.

Enables LiveReload to automatically refresh the browser.

Other reasonable defaults based on development instead of production.

## Build an executable JAR

You can run the application from the command line with Gradle or Maven. You can also build a single executable JAR file that contains all the necessary dependencies, classes, and resources and run that. Building an executable jar makes it easy to ship, version, and deploy the service as an application throughout the development lifecycle, across different environments, and so forth.

## Add a Home Page

Static resources, including HTML and JavaScript and CSS, can be served from your Spring Boot application by dropping them into the right place in the source code. By default, Spring Boot serves static content from resources in the classpath at /static (or /public). The index.html resource is special because, if it exists, it is used as a "`welcome page,"serving-web-content/ which means it is served up as the root resource (that is, at `http://localhost:8080/). As a result, you need to create the following file (which you can find in src/main/resources/static/index.html):

```
<!DOCTYPE HTML>
<html>
<head> 
    <title>Getting Started: Serving Web Content</title> 
    <meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=UTF-8" />
</head>
<body>
    <p>Get your greeting <a href="/greeting">here</a></p>
</body>
</html>
```

**When you restart the application, you will see the HTML at http://localhost:8080/.**

## Spring model attributes

Spring MVC calls the pieces of data that can be accessed during the execution of views model attributes. The equivalent term in Thymeleaf language is context variables.

## Request parameters

Request parameters can be easily accessed in Thymeleaf views. Request parameters are passed from the client to server like:
```https://example.com/query?q=Thymeleaf+Is+Great!```

## Session attributes

In the below example we add mySessionAttribute to session:
```@RequestMapping({"/"})
        String index(HttpSession session) {
            session.setAttribute("mySessionAttribute", "someValue");
            return "index";
        }
```

## ServletContext attributes

The ServletContext attributes are shared between requests and sessions. In order to access ServletContext attributes in Thymeleaf you can use the #servletContext. prefix:
```
        <table>
                <tr>
                    <td>My context attribute</td>
                    <!-- Retrieves the ServletContext attribute 'myContextAttribute' -->
                    <td th:text="${#servletContext.getAttribute('myContextAttribute')}">42</td>
                </tr>
                <tr th:each="attr : ${#servletContext.getAttributeNames()}">
                    <td th:text="${attr}">javax.servlet.context.tempdir</td>
                    <td th:text="${#servletContext.getAttribute(attr)}">/tmp</td>
                </tr>
            </table>
```

## Spring beans

Thymeleaf allows accessing beans registered at the Spring Application Context with the @beanName syntax, for example:
```
    <div th:text="${@urlService.getApplicationUrl()}">...</div>
