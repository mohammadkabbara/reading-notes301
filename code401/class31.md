# Target audience
Espresso is targeted at developers, who believe that automated testing is an integral part of the development lifecycle. While it can be used for black-box testing, Espressoâ€™s full power is unlocked by those who are familiar with the codebase under test.

## Synchronization capabilities
Each time your test invokes onView(), Espresso waits to perform the corresponding UI action or assertion until the following synchronization conditions are met:

The message queue is empty.

There are no instances of AsyncTask currently executing a task.

All developer-defined idling resources are idle.

By performing these checks, Espresso substantially increases the likelihood that only one UI action or assertion can occur at any given time. This capability gives you more reliable and dependable test results.

## Packages

espresso-web - Contains resources for WebView support.

espresso-idling-resource - Espresso's mechanism for synchronization with background jobs.

espresso-contrib - External contributions that contain DatePicker, RecyclerView and Drawer actions, accessibility checks, and CountingIdlingResource.

espresso-intents - Extension to validate and stub intents for hermetic testing.

espresso-remote - Location of Espresso's multi-process functionality.

# Create UI tests with Espresso Test Recorder 

The Espresso Test Recorder tool lets you create UI tests for your app without writing any test code. By recording a test scenario, you can record your interactions with a device and add assertions to verify UI elements in particular snapshots of your app. Espresso Test Recorder then takes the saved recording and automatically generates a corresponding UI test that you can run to test your app.

## Record an Espresso test
Espresso tests consist of two primary components: UI interactions and assertions on View elements. UI interactions include tap and type actions that a person may use to interact with your app. Assertions verify the existence or contents of visual elements on the screen. For example, an Espresso test for the Notes testing app might include UI interactions for clicking on a button and writing a new note but would use assertions to verify the existence of the button and the contents of the note.

## Record UI interactions
To start recording a test with Espresso Test Recorder, proceed as follows:

Click Run > Record Espresso Test.

In the Select Deployment Target window, choose the device on which you want to record the test. If necessary, create a new Android Virtual Device. Click OK.

Espresso Test Recorder triggers a build of your project, and the app must install and launch before Espresso Test Recorder allows you to interact with it. The Record Your Test window appears after the app launches, and since you have not interacted with the device yet, the main panel reads "No events recorded yet." Interact with your device to start logging events such as "tap" and "type" actions.

**To add an assertion to your test, proceed as follows:**

- Click Add Assertion. A Screen Capture dialog appears while Espresso gets the UI hierarchy and other information about the current app state. The dialog closes automatically once Espresso has captured the screenshot.

- A layout of the current screen appears in a panel on the right of the Record Your Test window. To select a View element on which to create an assertion, click on the element in the screenshot or use the first drop-down menu in the Edit assertion box at the bottom of the window. The selected View object is highlighted in a red box.

- Select the assertion you want to use from the second drop-down menu in the Edit assertion box. Espresso populates the menu with valid assertions for the selected View element.

- Click Save and Add Another to create another assertion or click Save Assertion to close the assertion panels.
